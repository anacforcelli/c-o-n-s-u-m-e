    # C O N S U M E


The game is about an intelligent monster. Its first impulse is to C O N S U M E. It will use every way and device it has to eat the world away bit by bit, leaving only scarred land in its wake, careless about the pain and loss it inflicts. Who knows if it enjoys it. Maybe the symphony of its destruction is even pleasing to its flesh.

But the world fights it. Any other living thing will flinch at its sight, and just the thought of it fills them with dread, but they take arms against it. Their leaders fill the people with hope that they can purge this 'evil' from the world and the siege gets ready to smash it back to oblivion.

You won't let that happen.
